# YourBurger

The idea behind this app comes from the need to learn new features of JavaScript.

In this project, I improved my JS skills, among them:
- OOP;
- JS classes
- advanced work with DOM, data attributes;
- Local storage

Technologies:
- HTML5;
- SVG;
- CSS3;
- Flex-box;
- Grid CSS;
- SCSS;
- Native JavaScript;
- Gulp;

In the future i will upgrade this app. What i want to do: 
- lazy loading for images; 
- try to make query on server and send mail with order; 
- catch some bugs and improve them.
